# Overview

As software engineers, we constantly try to learn coding language, Development IDE's, or new fundamental building blocks of how different software works. This is one such case, as I try to learn how to use mobile apps through emulators of various. Mobile applications are things I have not taken to seriously before attempting this learning environment, but once I have I have gained a new appreciation for those that have developed exclusively using mobile applications.


The mobile app that I created is a people profiler (though for demo purposes, i made it a bio for an idea that i had a while back), the use of the app is to select the button with the image of it, and that button changes the text of the application. When you open the App, you will be presented with a screen with a text, and several Buttons below. When you press the button the text from the image changes.

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how I learn how user interaction work in the mobile space and how changes can occur using java/kotlin coding languages.

# Future Work

1. Implement a secondary screen to pop up in front of the user to display text and Images to the user with an option to close out back to the main screen.
2. An option to have the user edit the Text and Images through a menu option.
3. An Option to delete People Pictures, Descriptions, and Button option through the user of a delete selected
4. Implementing a cloud database to store information on user saved images and text.
5. Implement a method to change Image based on Button.
